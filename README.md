# Interview Preparation
## Contains most common and famous questions from Data Structures and Algorithms.

This contains the codes that I wrote while studying Algorithms and Data structures.Also 
later on I added commonly asked Interview questions also, so you might see different solutions for the same questions as I merged all the codes together , so some are old and might contain some bugs.Most of the questions here are taken from geeksforgeeks, Elements of Programming Interview, Karumanchi etc.I highly recommend Elements of Programming Interview if you want to see some really elegant solutions, written in C++14.
Karumanchi for C users. 
The solution for the questions have been done mostly using C++14, though there might be some codes in C also.
The questions are the most commonly asked and must know algorithm and data structure questions asked in most of the big Tech. companies.
This has 350+ coding questions.
