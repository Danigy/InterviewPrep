# Interview Preparation
## My Solution code for most common and famous Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

This contains the codes that I wrote while studying Algorithms and Data structures.Also 
later on I added commonly asked Interview questions also, so you might see different solutions for the same questions as I merged all the codes together , so some are old and might contain some bugs.
The files have been arranged topic wise.

Most of the questions here are taken from geeksforgeeks, Elements of Programming Interview, Karumanchi etc. I highly recommend reading Elements of Programming Interview if you want to see some really elegant solutions, written in C++14, Karumanchi for C users. You can also try [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) for practice.

The solution for the questions have been done mostly using C++14, though there might be some codes in C also.
The questions are the most commonly asked and must know algorithm and data structure questions asked in most of the big Tech. companies.
There are 400+ coding problems.<br>
<b>NOTE: You may find multiple solution codes for the same problem.</b><br>

## Advanced Difficulty / STL with C++14:
For those who want to learn how to use STL for DS & Algo, you can check this repo:<br>
[EPI solutions repo](https://github.com/susantabiswas/epi-solutions). 
<br>Here you will find even difficult problems solved using STL. The problems are
from <strong>Elements of Programing Interviews</strong> book. The codes are full of comments for easier explanantion.
